            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version Control, also known as revision control or source control is a system that manages changes to documents, computer programs, large web sites, and other collections of information. The system holds one main repository for all project files. It records changes to any single or set of files over time so you can recall specific versions later. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person who is making the change. Therefore, if a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members. In this system files are not able to be overwritten and allows people to work simultaneously without any conflict.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system that is used for software development and other version control tasks. It is a distributed revision control system that is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. The major difference between Git and any other Version Control System is the way git thinks about its data. It thinks of its data as a set of snapshots of a miniature file system. To be as efficient as possible, it doesn’t store files again if they have not changed only a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. This allows Git to be a mini file system with powerful tools built on top of it making it more complex than other version control systems.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed version control, which can also be known as distributed revision control or decentralized version control, allows several software developers to work on a given project without requiring them to share a common network. This type of control takes a peer to peer approach as opposed to the client server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository, each peers working copy is a complete repository. If any server were to die, and these systems were collaborating via it, any client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is a full backup of all the data. Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs are all examples of Distributed Version Control Systems.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Remote Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of these, but each is generally a read only file for you. In order to collaborate with others, it involves managing the remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote repositories include knowledge of adding remote repositories, removing remotes that are no longer valid, managing remote branches and much more. To be able to collaborate on any Git project, knowing how to manage your remote repositories is crucial.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> A local repository is one that only you (the local user) can see. It exists only on your local machine. Because Git is a distributed version control system, your local repository has the exact same features and functionality as any other Git repository. The local repository consists of three “trees” maintained by Git. The first one is your working directory which holds the actual files. The second one is the Index which is the staging area. The third is the head which points to the last commit you have made. When you create a local repository, you can push it to a remote repository later if necessary.</p>
